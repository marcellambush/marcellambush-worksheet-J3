## Worksheet J3
**Question 1:**  
Polymorphism is a situation where a variable that is declared something at compile time can take on different compatible types at compile time    
**Question 2:**
Polymorphism makes this code possible because the toString method will call on u which can take on multiple different variables depending on its assignment at runtime  
**Question 3:**
It will print out "A" becuase the program will use the inheritance of D which then goes to C which then goes to A printing "A".  
**Question 4:**
It will print out "~~B~~ ~~B~~" by once again using inheritance   
**Question 5:**
It will print out "A A" because there is no toString in class B - it will try to find it in class B, but I will use inheritance and use toString in A.  
**Question 6:**
The program will not compile. This is because the access modifiers are different when theyre used from when they're declared. Protected does not equal private  
**Question 7:**
This will print out "A: 1" because it will use inheritance to print out the contents in the toString method  
**Question 8:**
It will print out "foo1: B B"  
**Question 9:**
It will print out the following snippet: 
- Name: fluffy
- Species: Canis Familaris(pomeranian)
- Name: george
- Species: Canis Familaris
- Name: brutus
- Species: Felis Catus(shorthair)"
    
**Question 10:**  
A.1 - It could print out 42 or 41  
A.2 - It could print out 50, 49, or 7  
A.3 - There would be an error because the specific baz method it is calling does not exist  

B.1 - 41    
B.2 - 50 
B.3 - This would not compile because it would try to return a character using inheritance - it would fail to do so  

D.1 - 42  
D.2 - 7   
D.3 - baz is not a defined method so it will not compile  

**Question 11:**
You can never call the abstract classe directly - you can only call it through super. During certain times there are reasons why we would not want to call certain classes.  
**Question 12:**
implemented class may be make, model, and year while the abstract class would probably hold fields like tires, steering wheel, etc.
